# Code4lib 2019 Community Support Squad Transparency Report

## Summary

The Community Support Squad (CSS) worked throughout the conference to respond to
violations of the [Code4lib Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct). Anne Slaughter and
Francis Kayiwa were co-coordinators, and Karen Coyle, Justin Coyne, Shaun Ellis,
Erin Fahy, Bobbi Fox, Wayne Graham, Megan Kudzia, Chad Nelson, Mark Matienzo
(LPC Liaison), and Aaron Collier (LPC Liaison) served as Community Support
Volunteers (CSVs). Prior to the Conference, Anne and Francis revised the
[procedures](https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct/blob/master/procedures.md)
and established a distinct [charge for the
CSS](https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct/blob/master/csvcharge.md). CSVs
were provided with background reading before the conference, and a training
session in San Jose.

During the conference, there were at least two CSVs on duty during all official
conference proceedings, and during most shifts there was an additional CSV
dedicated to monitoring online activity. CSVs were identified by striped
lanyards and posted in the back of the main room, and available to take reports
in person, via webform, or by phone (using a dedicated burner phone). We used
the Signal app and a private Slack channel to coordinate logistics, discuss
incidents, and come to consensus on responses.

### Incidents and Responses

1. Commenters on the YouTube stream got into a heated conversation that turned
   insulting. CSV stepped in with a general reminder about code of conduct and
   the CSS decided to turn off commenting on the stream.
2. A CSV encountered a hotel guest not affiliated with the conference who was
   disturbed by the all-gender restroom signage, and suggested they seek out a
   gender-specific restroom.
3. Comments made publicly about one of the conference speakers on Slack and
   Twitter become unwelcoming.
4. A report was taken regarding a microaggression experience by an attendee. An
   announcement was made from the podium the next morning reminding attendees to
   model desired behavior in the community. The statement was intended to
   address this report as well as the incident described in #3.

### Recommendations

The coordinators debriefed with each other and with the CSVs. In addition to the
experience and feedback we will use to improve CSS operations in the future
and/or pass on to future coordinators we have the following recommendations for
the community.

1. The community needs more specifically articulated and codified values. In
   addition to the Code of Conduct, this would provide a lens through which the
   community understands and models acceptable behavior.
2. The CSS should be a standing committee (as articulated in Mark Matienzo's
   lightning talk in San Jose). The official enforcement of the Code of Conduct
   should not be limited to the annual national conference. This standing
   committee would be initially led by Francis Kayiwa, Mark Matienzo, and Anne
   Slaughte, along with others in the community to be recruited, and would focus
   on revising the current Code of Conduct and establishing standing channels
   for detecting, reporting, and responding to violations. We would keep the
   email and anonymous webform open for reporting, and have discussions with
   CLIR regarding ongoing hosting and storage.
3. Conference planning considerations:
    * A follow-up survey of attendees would be generally useful for the incoming
      LPC. If established, this survey should include a mechanism for attendees
      to report code of conduct violations. The number of reports was down from
      previous years, which could signal fewer actual incidents, but it could
      also mean that incidents were not reported. This recommendation is one
      measure that may help us reduce barriers to and increase comfort levels
      with reporting.
    * It would be useful to have some preconference time dedicated to newcomer
      onboarding and/or community support-related content. This could take the
      form of one or more actual workshops, or a webinar in advance of the
      conference. Content could include the supports and tools currently in
      place in the community as well as general support for allies such as
      active bystander training, identifying and dealing with microaggressions,
      etc.
    * Briefly introduce all CSVs on stage at beginning of conference to
      facilitate recognition and allow them to set a welcoming tone.
