# Code4lib 2021 Community Support Squad Transparency Report

## Summary

The Community Support Squad (CSS) worked throughout the conference to respond to
violations of the [Code4lib Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct). Eric Phetteplace was CSS
Coordinator and Jeremy Friesen, Anne Slaughter, Wayne Graham, Bobbi Fox, Mike
Giarlo, Ann Marie Mesco, Shawn Averkamp, Louisa Kwasigroch, Kate Lynch, and
Michelle Janowiecki served as Community Support Volunteers (CSVs). Prior to the
Conference, Eric reviewed CSS materials to ensure they were suitable for a
virtual conference. CSVs were provided with background reading before the
conference and with an online training session.

During the conference, there were at least two CSVs monitoring online activity
during all official conference proceedings. CSVs identified themselves online
with a purple heart ðŸ’œ `:purple_heart:` emoji beside their name and announced
themselves on Slack at the beginning of their shifts. We used a private Slack
channel to coordinate logistics, discuss incidents, and come to consensus on
responses.

### Incidents and Responses

1. Language in an email to all presenters referred to a person's "preferred
   pronouns". Community members expressed anger at representing someone's
   pronouns as a mere preference. Community Support reached out to Concentra who
   immediately agreed to change their language on future communications and
   included an apology in the next email to presenters.

2. Prior to the conference, a community member reported an incident involving a
   pattern of hostile communication. While the CSS agreed that the communication
   was unbefitting of a welcoming community, due to the absence of any clear
   Code of Conduct violation we decided that there was not an evident need to
   take further action with the community members involved. However, we
   continued, as always, to monitor closely for the hostile pattern of speech.

### Recommendations

The CSS reiterates the call from the [2019 national conference transparency
report](https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct/blob/main/transparency_reports/2019_national_conference_annual_report.md) to codify our community values. We
believe this would clarify what being a welcoming community member means,
as opposed to only showing how to avoid Code of Conduct violations.

1. The community needs more specifically articulated and codified values. In
   addition to the Code of Conduct, this would provide a lens through which the
   community understands and models acceptable behavior.
