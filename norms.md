Community Norms and Values
==========================

## Introduction

[BIG TBD HERE!!]

As it is written on the Code4Lib [website](https://code4lib.org/about/), Code4Lib isn’t entirely about code or libraries. It is a *volunteer*-driven collective of hackers, designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on technology “stuff.” It started in the fall of 2003 as a mailing list when a group of library programmers decided to create an overarching community agnostic towards any particular language or technology.

Code4Lib is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. To that end, we've created an ever-evolving [Code of Code4Lib Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) , which addresses, in general, our expectations of the community.

This page serves to address some specific norms that we hope to promote for various Code4Lib channels.

## The listserv

The [listserv](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CODE4LIB) remains a vital part of the Code4Lib community.  

### Appropriate topics

Although its formal definition states that it "... provides a forum for discussion all things relating to programming code for libraries. This is a place to discuss particular programming languages, but also provides a place to discuss the issues of programming in libraries in general.", it can also be a place to discuss related topics, such as the issues of being the programmer in a library. The questions of  diversity, sexual harassment, microagressions, etc., may all be appropriate related topics of discussion.

### Anonymity

In general the community prefers to know who is writing. Exceptions may arise when the you feel at risk; in that case, the you may contact one or more [Community Support Volunteers](css_volunteers.md) for help forwarding your message.  At the least, your message should include a *reason* for why you are choosing to be anonymous. For example:

* "I'm looking for advice on how to present myself for another job, but my boss doesn't know I'm looking"
* "I'd like some advice in dealing with a programming
conflict, and other members of the team are on this list"

### Surveys

If you wish to ask people on the listserv to participate in a survey, you should minimally identify:

* yourself
* purpose of the survey
* the reason you're asking **in this listserv**
* what kinds of information you're collecting
* (if collecting identifying information such as email address, name), what you plan to do with it, and how you'll keep it secure.
